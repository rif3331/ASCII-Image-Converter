1. here the explains about every class we wrote:
- Image: Handles image changes, Divides images into sub-images and calculates brightness.
- SubImage: A specialized segment of an image, extends Image.
- Shell: Command-line interface for loading images and configuring settings,
generates and displays ASCII art using other components.
- AsciiArtAlgorithm: Divides images into sub-images, calculates brightness,
and maps brightness to ASCII characters.
- SubImgCharMatcher: Matches brightness values to ASCII characters for charset.
- BadCommandException: Handles invalid commands in the `Shell`.
- BadExtraArgsException: Handles errors when too many arguments are provided.
- UnKnownCategoryException: Handles errors for unknown categories in commands.

2.
- HashMap is used twice, once to store characters and their brightness before normalizing the results.
and used again after the normalizing of the results
It was chosen because it gives fast access and insertion, usually in O(1) time,
which is important for matching characters quickly.
we used 2 different HashMaps because we had to store the data also before normalizing the results,
to use it again every time we normalizing again, when we change the set,
and it will be more efficient, instead of calculate all the brightness all over again.
- ArrayList is used to manage lists of characters or processed images.
It works well because it lets us access elements quickly (O(1) for indexing) and adjusts
its size automatically, making it simple to use and memory-friendly.
- 2D boolean arrays are used to represent binary images, like parts of the input image
or character images. They are straightforward, use little memory, and give O(1) access to elements.
- 2D SubImage array that we used in AsciiArtAlgorithm, for remembering the last results
from the last run, that will be efficient if we used similar data (image, resolution and matcher)
like in the last run, instead of divide the image again.
3. we created exception class that are relevant only to us program, that use run-time
exception of java system. we created the classes for handle different situations of errors.
4. in the SubImgCharMatcher class we added 3 new public static fields for types of
rounding, it was necessary that we will write it there because only in this class
we have the algorithm that calculate the char that most close to the asked brightness.
we made it public because the user can change it from the interface, and we have to give the Shell
permission to touch it.
we also added printHashMap function that print the list of the characters with spaces,
we did it public because the user has the ability to ask for print all the characters by write 'chars'.
also, we added getNumberOfSet function that check the number of characters in charset,
we made it public because we use it in the shell, because we want to handle all the
exceptions in the Shell class, and it needed for check if the input is valid.
